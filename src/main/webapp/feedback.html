        <h1>Feedback for FLOW-1</h1>
        <p>This is our feedback:
            We really like the third semester website. It is easy to move around and you can always find what you're
            looking for with a few clicks.<br>
            
            The week with JavaScript was very overwhelming. We think the slides and explanation in class
            was not enough. Paticularly the fetch method gave us problems during the week but also in our CA1 project.
            We solved the problems now with extensive help from teachers and other students. <br>
            We feel like alot of the assignments during the same week were too big and we only had half a week to do them. During the same 
            week we also encountered problems with how to test, but we had them resolved during the Monday review.<br>
            
            Also on review day it would be a big help if the teacher would ask out in the open what assignments people had problems with and then explain/show a solution
            instead of making us prepare a presentation for the class. Review day is only 1.5 hour and therefore its not a problem to sit/watch/listen and learn.
